In Fall 2022, I co-taught CS 2800: Discrete Structures with <a href="https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html">Alexandra Silva</a>.

I will be teaching CS 2800 again this fall with <a href="https://www.noahsd.com/">Noah Stephens-Davidowitz</a>.

In Summer 2023, I taught ENGRI 1101: Engineering Applications of Operations Research as part of Cornell's <a href="https://sce.cornell.edu/courses/roster/pssp">Pre-Collegiate Summer Scholars Program</a>.

In addition, I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses:

## Cornell University

- CS 2111: Programming Practicum, Java (Spring 2022)
- CS 4820: Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms (Fall 2021)
- MATH 1106: Modeling with Calculus for the Life Sciences (Spring 2020, 2021)


## University at Buffalo

- CSE 250: Data Structures in C++ (Spring 2017, 2018)
- CSE 191: Discrete Mathematics (Fall 2017)
- MTH 241: Multivariable Calculus (Spring 2017)
- MTH 141: Introductory Calculus (Fall 2016)


Finally, I have had positions through the Cornell Math Department's [Active Learning Initiative](https://e.math.cornell.edu/sites/activelearn/) and the Cornell Computer Science Department to develop [course materials](materials/about/).
