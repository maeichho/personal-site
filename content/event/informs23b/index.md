summary: Recent work on causal inference under interference falls under two approaches, using structural assumptions on the interference effects to select a good randomized design or using structural assumptions on the potential outcomes to select a good estimator. In this work, we quantify the gains that can be made when these approaches are considered together, in particular by studying pseudoinverse estimators under cluster randomized designs. 

abstract: 'Existing literature on estimating causal effects under network interference falls under two primary approaches: leveraging assumptions on the interference to inform the experimental design or leveraging assumptions on the potential outcomes to inform the choice of estimator. These strategies have traditionally been considered in isolation; our work aims to understand and quantify their synergy. We present a general pseudoinverse estimator for causal effects under low-degree outcome models that works for arbitrary experimental designs. Next, we analyze the bias and variance of this estimator both for arbitrary designs and more specifically in the case of cluster randomized designs. Throughout, we see that the combination of cluster randomized designs and low-degree outcome models leads to more favorable properties than either strategy ensures on its own.'
