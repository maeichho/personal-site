summary: We consider the problem of finding Pareto efficient allocations that adhere to quota, eligibility, and priority constraints. We characterize this as a weighted bipartite matching problem with carefully chosen weights. This flexible formulation allows us to consider many problem extensions. We present three such extentions; for each we exhibit a clear dichotomy in which one possible extension is handled by a straightforward modification of our algorithm while a closely related extension is NP-hard.

abstract: 'In applications from rationing medical care to university admissions, the decision of who is allocated is justified by various normative criteria. Such settings motivate the following priority-respecting allocation problem: several categories wish to allocate their quota of interchangeable items to a set of agents. The goal is to find a Pareto efficient allocation that respects quotas and adheres to eligibility and priority requirements stipulated by the categories. We exhibit a bijection between such allocations and maximum-weight matchings under carefully chosen weights. This clean characterization recovers known results in this space and demonstrates that the problem straddles a fine line of computational efficiency. Some extensions of priority-respecting allocation are handled by specializations of our algorithm, while related extensions are NP-hard.'
