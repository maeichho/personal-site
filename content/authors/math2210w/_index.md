      Students set up a homogeneous linear system to balance each element in a chemical equation. This workshop demonstrates how understanding the solution space of a linear system can give insight into the feasibility of certain chemical reactions.

    summary: |
      Students make use of cofactor expansion in a geometric setting to derive the “Shoelace Formula” for the area of a general polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. Time permitting, students extend this formula to higher dimensions.

    summary: |
      Students are introduced to finite field arithmetic. Then, they explore howto use use linear transformations to introduce redundency into a message vector, allowing for error detection and correction. Students get practice encoding and decoding using small Hamming codes.
  - title: '4: Best Fit Curves (Sec. 5.6)'

    summary: |
      Students explore how we can not only use the method of least squares to approximate a linear function to data, but also to determine the best coefficients given any suitable basis functions. They are also introduced to the coefficient of determination, a metric for the quality of the approximation.
  - title: '5: Group Representations (Sec. 6.2)'

    summary: |
      This workshop serves as a gentle introduction to the subject of abstract algebra. Students are introduced to the definition of a group and explore some matrix groups. Then, they study group representations, maps from arbitrary groups to matrices which “preserve” the group operation as matrix multiplication. 
  - title: '6: An Algebraic Integration Technique (Sec. 6.4)'

    date: '2021-07-01'

    summary: |
      Students recall the tricky “wrap-around” integration by parts calculations from calculus. By recognizing that the derivative is an invertible linear transformation for some choices of basis functions, we can solve these integrals using matrix multiplication.
