I am a third-year PhD student in the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, where I am advised by <a href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/sbanerjee/">Siddhartha Banerjee</a>. My research focuses on the design of algorithms for combinatorial problems, particularly with applications to game theory. In addition, I have a passion for teaching and curricular development. I have helped to develop undergraduate course materials for the Cornell Math Department's Active Learning Initiative. Beyond academia, I am an avid baker and a devoted fan of the Buffalo Bills.
