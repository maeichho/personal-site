abstract: This project is a follow-up to Workshop 4. Students gather their own experimental data that models the quantitative relationship between two variables. They fit a linear model to the data, along with a custom-tailored model (chosen by plotting the data). Then, they use the coefficients of determination to analyze the quality of their models. <br><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-page-header" href="sample1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sample Project 1</a> <a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-page-header" href="sample2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sample Project 2</a>
