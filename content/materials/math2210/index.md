        Over the summer of 2021, I worked to develop six new workshops and one new project for the department's linear algebra course. 

        The workshops are completed in groups during a recitation section, and finalized and submitted by students individually over the following week. Each of the workshops is self-contained and allows students to explore an application of the topics that they are covering in lecture. Typically, six workshops are given throughout the semester. 

        The projects are completed individually and require students to carry out some research or data collection, calculation, and analysis. These projects are completed outside of class, similar to a homework assignment.

        All of the section numbers correspond to Nicholson's open access textbook <a href="https://lyryx.com/linear-algebra-applications/"><i>Linear Algebra with Applications</i></a>
