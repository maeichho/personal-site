    title: '1: Balancing Chemical Reactions (Sec. 1.3)'
    url: pdfs/reaction.pdf
    description: 'Students set up a homogeneous linear system to balance each element in a chemical equation. This workshop demonstrates how understanding the solution space of a linear system can give insight into the feasibility of certain chemical reactions.'

    title: '2: The Area of Polygons (Sec. 3.1)'
    url: pdfs/area.pdf
    description: 'Students make use of cofactor expansion in a geometric setting to derive the “Shoelace Formula” for the area of a general polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. Time permitting, students extend this formula to higher dimensions.'

    title: '3: Hamming Codes (Sec. 5.4)'
    url: pdfs/hamming.pdf
    description: 'Students are introduced to finite field arithmetic. Then, they explore howto use use linear transformations to introduce redundency into a message vector, allowing for error detection and correction. Students get practice encoding and decoding using small Hamming codes.'
    date_start: '2021-07-04'

  - organization: 'MATH 2210'
    title: '4: Best Fit Curves (Sec. 5.6)'
    url: pdfs/fitting.pdf
    description: 'Students explore how we can not only use the method of least squares to approximate a linear function to data, but also to determine the best coefficients given any suitable basis functions. They are also introduced to the coefficient of determination, a metric for the quality of the approximation.'

  - organization: 'MATH 2210'
    title: '5: Group Representations (Sec. 6.2)'
    url: pdfs/representation.pdf
    description: 'This workshop serves as a gentle introduction to the subject of abstract algebra. Students are introduced to the definition of a group and explore some matrix groups. Then, they study group representations, maps from arbitrary groups to matrices which “preserve” the group operation as matrix multiplication.'
    date_start: '2021-07-02'

  - organization: 'MATH 2210'
    title: '6: An Algebraic Integration Technique (Sec. 6.4)'
    url: pdfs/integrate.pdf
    description: 'Students recall the tricky “wrap-around” integration by parts calculations from calculus. By recognizing that the derivative is an invertible linear transformation for some choices of basis functions, we can solve these integrals using matrix multiplication.'
