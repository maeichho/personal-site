Over the summer of 2021, I worked to develop materials for the support course for CS 2800. In the support course, students revisit the material and work in groups on additional exercises. The worksheets are listed chronologically, and each corresponds to roughly one week of class material. Inspiration for many of the questions comes from Lehman, Leighton, and Meyer's <a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring18/mcs.pdf"><i>Mathematics for Computer Science</i></a>.
