    title: 'Chapter 2: An Introduction to Calculus'
    url: pdfs/chapter2.pdf
    description: '<p style="text-align: justify;">A more formal treatment of introductory calculus, these notes are meant to be a companion to chapter 2 of <i>Modeling Life</i>. They motivate calculus, and present the definition of limits, derivatives, and integrals. In addition, applications such as linear approximation and using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to solve definite integrals are discussed. Finally, a discussion of solving separable differential equations uses calculus to provide a derivation of the Lotka-Volterra predation equations.</p>'
